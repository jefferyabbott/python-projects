# Just some Python stuff

I have not written any Python in about 10 years. My primary languages are JavaScript, Java, Swift, Ruby and lately, Go. Since I have a job interview this coming week that will require a Python code challenge, I'm getting myself ready with some simple random projects just to get the syntax in my head.

Enjoy. If you see anything that could be improved, send me a PR or open an issue.
